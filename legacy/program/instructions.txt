HOW TO PLAY:

High or Low:
A dice will be rolled with a number from 1 to 6 and shown to you. Your job is to guess whether the next roll will be higher, lower, or the same. 

Dice War:
Two dice will be rolled; one for the CPU, one for you. 
The higher roll wins the round. 
Draws are not allowed, so a second roll will be attempted automatically if both dice have the same score.

Dice Roll:
A number 1 through 6 will be rolled. Less a game, more a random number generator

Goose's Gambit:
You and the dealer will both roll six dice at once to get a hand.
Either player's score is calculated with the following formulae:
- Straight: 100,000
- Five of a kind: value × 10,000
- Four of a kind: value × 5,000
- Three of a kind: value × 1,000
- A pair: value × 100
- The highest value die: value × 10

Note that a score of zero is impossible with these rules.

After you see your hand, you can choose to keep it, or roll a new one.
If you choose to roll a new hand, you're stuck with it - no going back.

Due to budget constraints, a goose has been hired to play as the dealer. 
However, as he doesn't know how to play, he will always keep whatever he rolls first.

Good luck!
